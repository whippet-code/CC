# Creative Code - Canvas API

Despite being a big fan of p5.js, one must does need to spend time a little closer to the metal at times. If only to appreciate more what processing gives us
in it's ability to enalbe very rapidly prototype concepts and ideas, but also in it's approachability for newcomers.

## This repo

This repo is my current work using "vanilla" JS and the Canvas API. This brings with it a huge leap in performance when it comes to larger and more complex pieces but also 
to any site that it may be used on for display.
